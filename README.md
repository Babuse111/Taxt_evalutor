This is a function that when passed a sentence with the term “share” and the word “email” says if the sentence falls more under “Student has shared” or “Student wants to know if can share”

The function will work as follow, passes the test on the function it will then return whether the student is asking to share the email  or the student already shered the email . also if the email is not based on asking to shere the email  it will also tell that.

I created a TestCase subclass named Testfuntion. From the same directory as the test_case_funtion.py file, to run the test user the following command:

the 'OK' which means that the funtion has passed the test

For any one to run the funtion locally must used python programming language compiler to his/her local machine, and download/copy a function filr to my github repo files
